    <p>Hello again! As I mentioned on my home page, my name is Adriana Delgado. I prefer to be called Adi. I am 24 years old and a senior in the Strategic Communication program in the Communication and Journalism Department at the University of New Mexico. I am originally from Cuba, New Mexico, but have lived in multiple places throughout the state. I'm the one in the picture above. It would be a bit weird if it wasn't me, right?</p>
      <p>I currently work a small hobby farm in Northern New Mexico where I grow a handful of pumpkin varieties, squash, and tomatoes. I enjoy developing recipes that use the crops I grow and plan my personal garden around specific recipes. Along with cooking, I enjoy baking to the point that I officially consider it an amateur hobby. By this time next year, I hope to be able to sell some of my baked goods at craft fairs and other food sales. </p>
      <p>As you might have guessed from my blog examples on my portfolio page, writing, and music are two of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy fiction writing and hope to self-publish a novel in the near future. I'm also working on a military sci-fi webcomic with a Europe-based artist and am hoping to have it published in the next few months or so. As for music, I try to keep up with a little bit of everything. I pride myself on the juxtaposition of some of my music tastes, and hobbies in general!</p>
