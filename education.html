      <p>In 2017, I graduated from Cuba High School in Cuba, New Mexico. I started at the University of New Mexico that fall in the Biology program with the intention of eventually going to veterinary school. I continued on that path until the COVID-19 pandemic hit during the Spring 2020 semester. I was forced to reevaluate my plans during that time as I was unable to continue in-person classes when UNM resumed in-person operations.</p>
      <p>For the Fall semester of 2020, I transferred to Central New Mexico Community College (CNM) in order to continue taking classes that were available online. During that time, I earned an Associate of Applied Science in Integrated Studies, an Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts, and an Associate of Arts in Communication. It was also around that time that I discovered my interest in writing, or perhaps it was more of a re-discovery. After earning an AA in Communication, I reapplied to UNM and started the online Strategic Communication program through the Department of Journalism and Mass Communication. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2024. </p>
      <p>While my education path feels like a nontraditional whirlwind, I enjoyed my time in each program I attempted. I enjoy having a diverse background of knowledge even though I don't have a degree to show for all my time studying organic chemistry. In the future, I might consider continuing my education, but for now, I would like to get some experience under my belt and continue adapting my skills to our modern, media-saturated society. </p>
