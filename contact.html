      <p>If you would like to get in contact with me for any reason, please feel free to reach out via the email link below. I am not accepting writing commissions at the moment but if that changes I will update this page accordingly. If you have any questions about anything you see on this site, I am available through email. </p>
      <p>As I mentioned on my home page, I am always happy to receive constructive criticism or feedback. If you have any opinions or ideas for improvement that you would like to share, let me know. I will try to respond to anyone who reaches out to me via email. I believe skills should constantly be improved, and because of that philosophy, I know this site isn't perfect. I know my writing could use some work. I know my photography skills could use some practice. But this is where my skills are right now, and everything you see here will be improved upon someday. So, please, share your opinions with me. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, if you saw something you liked that you would like advice on, let me know of that as well. I would be happy to offer advice or guidance on any of the topics or mediums covered in my portfolio. I believe that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn or develop any skill. If there is a possibility that we could help each other out and save each other some trial and error, I would be happy to engage. </p>
      <p>Thanks again for checking this out!      </p>
