      <p>Hello all and welcome to my digital portfolio. My name is Adriana Delgado but you can call me Adi.In poking around here you will find information about me, some of my achievements, and examples of the sort of work I like to do. As you will learn from my About page, I strive to learn as many mediums as possible while mastering those that I find useful to myself and my clients. My Portfolio page highlights my skills in photography, writing, design, and general content creation. My Education tab discusses my academic achievements, how they came to be, and how I apply what I have learned in my personal life and professional endeavors.</p>
      <p>I like to work on creative projects, no matter how that creativity is applied. I understand that turning ideas into visual and tangible concepts can be a very personal experience that requires adaptability. The work I have displayed here demonstrates my versatility both in a professional and personal sense. </p>
      <p>This site was crafted with Adobe Dreamweaver using HTML5 and CSS. Stylistic elements were created using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. My personal brand is still in the works, and my skills are still being developed. As a creative in training, I welcome constructive criticism and overall feedback. If you would like to get in touch with me, please check out my Contact page. I look forward to hearing anything you have to say! </p>
      <p>Thanks again for stopping by. I hope you enjoy my portfolio!</p>
